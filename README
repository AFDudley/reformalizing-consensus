This is a repo of the LaTeX for my ``reformalizing consensus'' paper ;)

The purpose of this paper is to define blockchain-based consensus, and economic consensus protocols. 
It demonstrates use of the language provided in an analysis of Bitcoin, and an analysis of Tendermint.


How I compile:

pdflatex reformalizing\ consensus.tex
bibtex reformalizing\ consensus.aux
pdflatex reformalizing\ consensus.tex
pdflatex reformalizing\ consensus.tex


Pull requests welcome!
