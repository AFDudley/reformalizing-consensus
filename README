This is a repo of the LaTeX for my ``reformalizing consensus'' paper ;)

The purpose of this paper is to define blockchain-based consensus, and economic consensus protocols.


How I compile:

pdflatex reformalizing\ consensus.tex
bibtex reformalizing\ consensus.aux
pdflatex reformalizing\ consensus.tex
pdflatex reformalizing\ consensus.tex


Pull requests welcome!
